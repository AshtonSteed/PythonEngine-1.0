# PythonEngine-1.0

The meat of this engine was built by following Eddie Sharick's python chess engine tutorial series on youtube. 

Other than that, the sub-file chess contains images of the pieces, and the computer can play at a depth specified by key press, and only operates with a basic eval and alpha beta search.

Its rudimentary, but it was a fun project.
